  <p>Elizabeth is currently a student at moringa taking a prep class in coding. Why i decided to do coding is because of my interest in data analytics data science and data engineering.</p>
  <p>I have a degree in Mathematical Sciences and currently working as an auditor and a part-time data analyst in an audit firm. I am on a path to change careers and become a full data engineer and that is my main reason for joining moringa school.</p>
  <p>My hobbies include reading self developmant books, attending entrepreneurship workshops, hiking and camping.</p>
